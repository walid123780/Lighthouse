When I suppose to update x (greadily) more than once , than we calculate the answer for it greedily and remember it.
In future , we will no longer check from 0 , but with the previous answer.


            j = mp1[k];
            for(ll i = j ; ; i+=k)
            {
                if(// do something)
                {
                    mp1[k] = i;
                }
            }
