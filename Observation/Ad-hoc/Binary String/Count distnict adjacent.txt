if you select an arbitary index i , and all value oppsite from i to n . 
than you want make string non-decresing in minimum operation.

my claim ,  just count distinct adjcent .

because,

	to make string non - decresing in minimum operation you should operation which s[i] == '1'  from (i <= n-1)
	
	intially s = 101;
	than , 
		101
		i = 1 ~> 101 ---> 010 , I do a operation in i = 1 , s[i+1] == 1 and s[i] = 0 . (before opearation s[2] == 0 , after s[2] == 1)
		i = 2 ~> 010 ---> 101 , than,I do a operation in i = 2 , s[i+1] == 1 ans s[i] = 0 .(now, we must operation s[2] now beacase s[2] hold 1)
	
   
	so , Another word , just count distinct adjcent;
